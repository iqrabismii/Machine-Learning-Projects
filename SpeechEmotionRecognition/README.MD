## Introduction 
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a field of study that aims to automatically recognize the emotional state of a speaker based on their speech signals. It involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze the acoustic features of speech, such as pitch, loudness, and spectral characteristics, to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. SER has many practical applications, such as improving human-computer interaction, developing virtual assistants, and detecting emotional distress in individuals.

## Librosa 
Librosa is a popular Python package for audio signal processing that helps in feature extraction from audio files. It provides functions for computing features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma, and spectral contrast. These features can be used for tasks such as speech emotion recognition and music genre classification. Librosa also provides functionality for time-series analysis and visualization of audio data.

## Data Science and Machine Learning 
A Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLP) is a feedforward neural network that can be used to recognize speech emotions. It optimizes the log-loss function using LBFGS or stochastic gradient descent. MLPs can model complex relationships between input features and output classes, making them suitable for speech emotion recognition. MLPs have internal weights that can be adjusted during training to optimize classification accuracy.
